# LibrariesAppTWD
There's an app to try the libs at the ``/projects/app``
You can make changes on the component of the library directly modifying the files. You will be able to see all the changes if you run ``bun run watchAuth`` while you are running the app using ``ng s app``.

Now tailwind is installed in the project just like the way the [official docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/angular) tell us to do it. Thus, you can enable or disable tailwindcss by adding / removing the ``@import "tailwindcss";`` in the ``/app/styles.css``.

Don't mind the name of the angular project. It's created as *app*, which should be changed in the future for not to confuse it with the Angular app subdirectory of the projects.
