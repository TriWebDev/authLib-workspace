# LibrariesAppTWD
There's an app to try the libs at the ``/projects/app``
You can make changes on the component of the library directly modifying the files. You will be able to see all the changes if you run ``bun run watchAuth`` while you are running the app using ng s app.

The tailwind is now installed in the index.html of the project by using the link tag in the head. This is provisional and you can remove it to see the changes without tailwind.
